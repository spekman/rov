    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>hi i'm a 19 year old programmer from brazil. my passions include watching paint dry and listening to music.</p>
    <p>my favorite videogames are the pokemon and touhou franchises but i'm also obsessed with puzzle and arcade games.
    </p>
    <p>my favorite musical genres are k-pop, j-pop and r&b but i'll listen to anything you send me.</p>
    <p>i'm not really confortable being open about myself so i guess this website is my way of stepping out of my
        comfort zone while being 100% inside it (i really love making websites lol) so if you think this is too short
        and generic you're right but i'm also working really hard on it!
    </p>

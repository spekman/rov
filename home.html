	<h1>welcome!</h1>
	<p>so this is another website i made because i guess there weren't enough projects for me to jump to whenever i got bored.
		 the site used to be just the game tab but it wasn't fleshed out enough to be it's own thing so i remade everything and turned
		 the game into what it looks now.</p>

	<h2>who are you?</h2>
	<p>i guess the better question would be "why are you talking about yourself here when there's already another tab called 'about'?"
		and well, i've been getting the aesthetics down for too long and i needed to release everything prematurely
		so that means no about and links tab YET.
	</p>
	<p>either way hi i'm a 19 year old programmer from brazil. my passions include watching paint dry and listening to music.
		my favorite videogames are the pokemon and touhou franchises but i'm also obsessed with puzzle and arcade games.
		my favorite musical genres are k-pop, j-pop and r&b but i'll listen to anything you send me.

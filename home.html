	<h1>welcome!</h1>
	<p>hey this is another website i made because i guess there weren't enough projects for me to jump to whenever i got
		bored.
		the site used to be just the game tab but it wasn't fleshed out enough to be it's own thing so i remade
		everything and turned
		the game into what it looks now.</p>

	<p>there are many things to do here like play the game on the game tab and open the album to see a cool design portfolio,
		or just read the few words that are written
		elsewhere. i'd do a guide or something like that but i'm sure you can figure out how to get around here, right?
	</p>

	<p>if you have a button and want me to add it here, just ask me on the guestbook! (i'd really love to)</p>
